Notes from previous releases, TODO review and update:
 - The Linux and Windows builds include a gamepad mapping database from the SDL_GameControllerDB project: https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB. To view a copy of the project's license, visit https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/LICENSE.
 - The database has also been preprocessed with a script by @offalynne https://gist.github.com/offalynne/e0a887556e8120390fc86c944e6861bf to make it compatible with Studio 1.4.9999.
